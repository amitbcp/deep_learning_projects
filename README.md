# Projects based on Deep Learning

Deep Learning has taken the tech industry by storm. With applications ranging across domains, this repository focuses on some use-case based projects of Deep Learning.
The major focus that can be seen is on Computer Vision based applications.

Most of the projects were done as a part of the  [**Computer Vision Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) & [**Self-Driving Car Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) from [**Udacity**](https://www.udacity.com/). Indivuidual projects have been described in detail for the approach & solution in their respective README.
